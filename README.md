# D3 Particle Simulator

This is an implementation of a particle simulator in D3 inspired by the
collider demo. This implementation provides many exciting features including:

* Dynamically set gravity and charge
* Randomized size and charge percentages
* Interaction with the mouse
* User-control of these values through dynamic sliders

To run, just clone this repo, `npm install d3`, and open `index.html` for fun!

This was originally a project from [Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. 
This project was worked on with a pair.
